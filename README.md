# Ticker

Ticker consumes the New York Times top stories API to give user a simple interface for seeing today's top stories fast. An intuitive button interface provides quick filtering and large clickable cards trigger a modal for viewing story details. The app is fully tabbable. 

## Running the App
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install
3. npm start to run the developer server

## Planning
The app was created as a take home assignment with a timeline of 6 hours. This is tight time restriction called for a simple design and user flow. Wireframes were created to ensure the layout was thought through prior to the start of coding.
